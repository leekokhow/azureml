My interest is to explore how to operationalize machine learning with Azure Machine Learning. So I created these tutorials as "quick-start" guides for anyone interested to hands-on Azure Machine Learning service and the Azure ML SDK for Python. The topics are based on microsoft how-to-use-azureml tutorials, but I added more detailed steps to illustrate how a model is developed and deployed.

To get started, try predict-employee-retention-part1-training.ipynb.

The "Quickstart Guide for Using Azure Machine Learning.pdf" provide steps to create Azure account and Azure Machine Learning Workspace.

The example is further extended to demonstrate MLOps, which you can find [here](https://github.com/leekokhow/MLOpsPy).

Added tutorial 4 on Automated ML using the Azure ML SDK for Python.

If you are interested in exploring Azure Search to incorporate a "ranking" model, do check out Evelyn's tutorial at [evelyntan-xp /

Happy learning!
