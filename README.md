My interest is to explore how to operationalize machine learning with Azure Machine Learning. So I created these tutorials as "quick-start" guides for anyone interested to hands-on Azure Machine Learning service and the Azure ML SDK for Python. The topics are based on microsoft how-to-use-azureml tutorials, but I added more detailed steps to illustrate how a model is developed and deployed. To get started, try predict-employee-retention-part1-training.ipynb. Happy learning!
